# 0x1D. C - Binary trees #

## Description ##
This project is about Binary Trees in C and other tree-type data structures.

## Learning Objectives ##
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Usage ##
* All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS on gcc 4.8.4
using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All files were linted for syntax and style with Betty
